# Autonomous Database Start and Stop

The autonomous database allows you to start your instance very rapidly on demand. It also allows you to stop your instance on demand as well to conserve resources and to pause billing. 

**WARNING:** when you do pause billing, you will not be charged for any CPU cycles because your instance will be stopped. However, you'll still be incurring charges for your monthly billing for your storage.

In addition to allowing you to start and stop your instance on demand, it's also possible to scale your database instance on demand as well.

All of this can be done very easily using the **Database Cloud Console**. You can also invoke REST services to perform these operations as well should you wish to script or automate any of these operations.
