# Spatial Database

Spatial data specifies a real-world location and hence relates disparate entities, such as people, events, or activities that are or occur at that location. Virtually any enterprise data includes some aspect of location.

Oracle allows you to manage locations as just another attribute in your enterprise data. Location analytics is integrated with the rest of Oracle's data management capabilities, making it simple for developers and analysts to use. This allows you to deal with all kinds of geospatial data, making use of the multimodal capabilities of Oracle converged database. 

Oracle spatial offering consists of three parts:

1. The first is the core facial functionality in the database to store, query, and analyze spatial data via SQL. We provide hundreds of operators and functions to search, categorize, filter, aggregate, enrich, or otherwise modify spatial data. 

2. The second part is a number of components, APIs, and services that make it simpler for developers to build spatial application. This enables programmers to use their language or framework of choice like Java, Python, JavaScript, wrestle services to do things like visualize maps or perform advanced analytics, such as route calculations and so on. 

3. The third part is a self service tool called **Spatial Studio**, which makes it easier than ever for nonexperts to get started with spatial.

## Spatial Studio

Spatial Studio has an intuitive browser-based self service drag and drop user interface. It's designed to enable analysts and nontechnical users to get started with creating maps and performing spatial analysis without writing a single line of code.

Spatial included with the Autonomous Database without any additional cost but requires additional compute resources. It is available as a deployable JEE application on the Oracle Cloud marketplace.
