## CI/CD for APEX

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. 

It is **automation** into the various stages of the development life cycle. It introduces **consistency** into your development process.

The development in the APEX flow is a lot different than the traditional one we see with that. And it's mainly because it's a **stateful versus stateless** process. It's not always easy to version in APEX. And it's not always easy to version in the database rolling back.
